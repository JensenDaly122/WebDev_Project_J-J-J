Dear Mr Snow
We at the SLOPE team have created a unique website for curious snow sport connoisseurâ€™s like yourself. We wish to create a safe and informative environment for everyone. We have done this by differentiating posts by colour correlating to the level of the snow-boarder and skier etc. We have designed the layout with light blue colours to fit the snow theme. Alongside this we include pictures of mountaintops in the background.

We have tried to make this as suitable as comfortable as comfortable to use by adding a drop-down menu and using different filters to change between posts. We hope that you like these ideas and get back to us as soon as possible with feedback so we can change anything you do not like.

King regards SLOPE
